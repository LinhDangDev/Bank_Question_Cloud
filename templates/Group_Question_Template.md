## üìö Template 1: Reading Comprehension (Ti·∫øng Anh)

```
Questions (1)-(4) refer to the following passage: (CLO3)

[<sg>]
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems.

The IoT concept has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including wireless communication, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation, and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of Things.
